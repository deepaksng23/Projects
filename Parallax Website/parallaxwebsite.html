        <h2 class="class1">Adventure Time!</h2>
        <p class="text">An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically bold, sometimes risky.[1] Adventures may be activities with danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, scuba diving, river rafting, or other extreme sports.
            <br> 
            <br>
            Adventures are often undertaken to create psychological arousal or in order to achieve a greater goal, such as the pursuit of knowledge that can only be obtained by such activities.

            <h2 class="desc"> BIKING</h2>
            
        </div>
        <p class="text">A sport bike (sports motorcycle, or sports bike) is a motorcycle designed and optimized for speed, acceleration, braking, and cornering on asphalt concrete race tracks and roads. 
            <br> 
            <br>
            They are mainly designed for performance at the expense of comfort, fuel economy, and storage in comparison with other motorcycles.
            Sport bikes can be and are typically equipped with fairings and a windscreen to deflect wind from the rider to improve aerodynamics.

            <h2 class="desc"> PARAGLIDING</h2>
            
        </div>
        <p class="text">Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure. The pilot sits in a harness or in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. 
            <br> 
            <br>
            Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.

            <h2 class="desc"> SURFING</h2>
            
        </div>
        <p class="text">Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. 
            <br> 
            <br>
            Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.
